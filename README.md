# Crypto-Flyer
Mobile side scrolling game

Hello all! 

Crypto-Flyer (Working Title) is a 2D side scrolling game that is intended for mobile devices. 

The game uses touch input to control the player object, with an objective of avoiding the flying space stones while staying on screen.

The options scene still needs to be added, as well as the possibility of more graphics in the scrolling background.

Comments and feedback are always welcome!
